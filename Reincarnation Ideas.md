You have different stats based off of your reincarnation start.

If you are born into a wizard family, you have a gift for that.

The stats should be natural, the numbers should not lock the player, and instead serve the player.

We should make as many stats as invisible as possible.

We can have your background give you immediate trust with key players that have familiarities.

You could be born as one of several classes?

You could choose the class for your cards before your next reincarnation.
