# Why?
The card combat is to give the player "power".
The player is very flexible in their ability to choose quests and move about.
However, when faced with a deadly obstacle, they must use their power to overcome it.
To make this power interactive in the game, we will make a card-based combat system.
## Overview
The player will have a draw-deck, a hand, and a discard-pile.
Once the draw-deck is empty, the discard-pile is shuffled into it to refill the draw-deck and leave an empty discard-pile.
There will one player against one or many enemies.
The enemies and cards will simulate an actual fight.
## General Ideas
The enemies should not be filled with unique mechanics.
They should present choices and interesting ways to beat them.
They should be dangerous, a do or die scenario.
## Swordsman
There are 3 main parts to the swordsman cards.
- Attacks: dealing damage, on the offensive
