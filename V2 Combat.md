All abilities and stats are in cards, no numbers out of cards.

Birth abilities are in your basic deck.

Your memory cards will come with you from the previous life.

You will choose a limited amount.

When you grow up, you will learn more cards.

Your main weapon (sword, spell type) is a card that changes if you upgrade it.

Weapons, spells, and equipment are cards.

Health will be the only number stat.

The health bar can be a bookmark.

Your HP depends on age (bell curve) and skill (positive).

If you try to revive but have 0 lives, you have ran out of lives.

If you run out of lives, you can choose to end the game or loan a life.

The loan gives 1 life, but your next cycle costs 2 lives.

In a cycle, in order to get a life, you can: 
1. You can get enough Soul Essence from killing people.
2. You can accomplish enough Great Deeds or Minor Deeds.
3. You can also get a rare item to get a life.
