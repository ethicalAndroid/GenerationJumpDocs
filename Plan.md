We should make a full, small game instead of half of a large game.

We want a small island, a small amount of key players.

Island biomes:
- Desert
- Grass
- Ice Mountain
- Fire Mountain
- Forest

Each one can become a village.

In terms of different types of people, most of these guys are going to be the same type of people.

We are not making 25 different people, we are making 5 groups of people spread out in different places.

(^ eh, we'll see.)
